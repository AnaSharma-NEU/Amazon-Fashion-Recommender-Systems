Companies like Amazon,Instakart,Spotify and Netflix offer Recommendation Based personalization services to it's customers. This helps the companies to retain their customers and also 
increase there revenue on an annual basis.

There are majorly two major recommendation systems:

<h2>Content Based Recommendation Systems </h2>

In this method the user gets a recommendation similar to the product that he may have bought or he may be viewing online.

<h2> Collaberation Based Recommendation System </h2>

In this method maybe two similar customers may have purchased an item that lies along the same features. Both the users are then sent recommendations stating that the other user has bought this item, would you like to buy it?


A lot of thought goes into recommendation. Certain items can be bought frequently like milk, egg, however certain items may not be bought so often like skate board,
phone etc. Analysing the past purchases, understanding the customer, checking the ratings etc.
In this project I have used the basic concept of recommendation system and tried to create a python simulation with Amazon Fashion Dataset.
